# CLI Command Logic

This directory contains the implementation of the command-line interface (CLI) commands for FinTrack Pro, built using the `Typer` framework.

Each Python file here corresponds to a set of related CLI commands:
- `log.py`: Implements commands for logging transactions (e.g., `add`, `log` with AI parsing).
- `view.py`: Implements commands for viewing data (e.g., `dashboard`, `list`).
- `budget.py`: Implements commands for managing budgets.

These modules define how FinTrack Pro responds to user input from the terminal.
