# Data Models

This directory defines the database schemas (models) for the FinTrack Pro application using `SQLModel`.

Currently, it includes:
- `transaction.py`: Defines the `Transaction` table structure.
- `budget.py`: Defines the `Budget` table structure.

These models are used to interact with the SQLite database, providing an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer for data persistence.
