# Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the FinTrack Pro application.

To run tests:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Execute tests using `pytest`:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

Each module within `app/` should have a corresponding test file (e.g., `test_models.py`, `test_services.py`) within this `tests/` directory to ensure proper functionality and maintainability.
